        <p>I am a 17 year old from the U.S and I am currently a junior in highschool. I am trying to
            improve my computer science skills as it will very likely be my future. In my free time i enjoy playing
            sports
            and playing video games. I love to try new things so I experience everythnig as much as I can. I take great
            pleasure in limit testing. </p>

        <h1 class="header"><u>What i learned in this class</u></h1>
        <p>In this class I learned a little more about html and css and ways I can make my code simpler.
            I can apply my
            knowledge from this class to my future web designs. </p>
